<h1><span lang="EN-GB">Phase One: Fuel Stage</span></h1>
<p>On your way to the fuel there are so many different scenarios and paths that we&rsquo;d have to cover,&hellip; that we re just not going to do it. I&rsquo;d like to mention that we only played the Beta for a whole of ~20hours before writing this guide so we can not really cover every possible path. But here is some general information to get you around.</p>
<h3>General Guide for moving fuel around.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scout always goes first with an assault covering him, medic in the middle and at the end you should have another assault covering the technician.</li>
<li>Never split the group.</li>
<li>Give the technician time to barricade everything around you, don&rsquo;t let him behind.</li>
<li>On your way to the fuel, loot every room that is on the way but do not take major detours.</li>
<li>While looting, always have your team in at least two rooms or looking down both ways in a corner (i.e. three guarding the hallway, while two loot a classroom or laboratory) to prevent the killer from spawning in close.</li>
<li>If you are in the basement make sure to check out the &lsquo;fenced&rsquo; square-y area with lots of football equipment, in the top right corner there can spawn a HOCKEY STICK or a shocker. The Hockey Stick is quite strong and can be used up to 8 timses, sadly cannot be crafted.</li>
</ul>
