<h1><span lang="EN-GB">Phase One: Fuel Stage</span></h1>
<p>On your way to the fuel there are so many different scenarios and paths that we&rsquo;d have to cover,&hellip; that we re just not going to do it. I&rsquo;d like to mention that we only played the Beta for a whole of ~20hours before writing this guide so we can not really cover every possible path. But here is some general information to get you around.</p>
<h3>General Guide for moving fuel around.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scout always goes first with an assault covering him, medic in the middle and at the end you should have another assault covering the technician.</li>
<li>Never split the group.</li>
<li>Give the technician time to barricade everything around you, don&rsquo;t let him behind.</li>
<li>On your way to the fuel, loot every room that is on the way but do not take major detours.</li>
<li>While looting, always have your team in at least two rooms or looking down both ways in a corner (i.e. three guarding the hallway, while two loot a classroom or laboratory) to prevent the killer from spawning in close.</li>
<li>If you are in the basement make sure to check out the &lsquo;fenced&rsquo; square-y area with lots of football equipment, in the top right corner there can spawn a HOCKEY STICK or a shocker. The Hockey Stick is quite strong and can be used up to 8 timses, sadly cannot be crafted.</li>
</ul><h3>When a fight breaks out</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assaults attack.</li>
<li>Scout saves his flash for a strategically significant moment mid-fight (i.e. Brute&rsquo;s grab, Strangler&rsquo;s chain or when the killer has almost killed someone).</li>
<li>Try to not start a fight with the flash since the assaults will take a while to reach the killer.
<ul>
<li>Killers can also see the flash coming at the begining, but when they are busy hitting the Assaults your flash won&rsquo;t miss!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medic heals the player that is getting hit.</li>
<li>Technician puts down his turret in a strategically significant area, then continues carrying the fuel to the lift.</li>
<li>Player holding the shocker uses the shocker sporadically to interrupt the killer&rsquo;s strong attacks
<ul>
<li>But doesn&rsquo;t waste it on Strangler since assaults can take him down on their own.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As soon as the killer died you make your way to the person holding the fuel.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One thing we would like to emphasize on here is that it is not always wise to kill the killer just because you&rsquo;d have the opportunity to do so. As you may have noticed, killers have areas that give them advantages and then there are sections in the map where they perform fairly bad.&nbsp; Therefor, if you happen to have a killer while you are in an area where he can not perform to his full potential, we advice that you keep him alive instead of just killing him off, if possible.&nbsp;</p>
