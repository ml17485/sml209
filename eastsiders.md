<h2>Class Set up:</h2>
<p>Two Assaults, a Medic, Scout and Tech are what we consider the most effective set up for a team that does not use voice chat or playing with random people that you did not decide strategy on. Let the Technician take the shocker that you get for free in the room you all spawned in so that they can shock the Slasher or Giant after using their primary ability.</p>
<h3>Who gets scrap first:</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 scrap for Medic to get extra charges</li>
<li>5 scrap for technician for faster crafting</li>
<li>10 scrap for one of the assaults to upgrade their base weapon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the Killer should have selected a character and make his way to you. Depending on the character you do as follows:</p>
<p>Giant: Get the second upgrade for the technician&rsquo;s turret. Get a helmet or make a baseball bat for someone that doesnt have a weapon yet.</p>
<p>Strangler: Get the second upgrade for the technician&rsquo;s turrets. Don&rsquo;t get a helmet.</p>
<p>Slasher: The other Assault needs a baseball bat, the free molotov might come in handy so let someone hold on to that. Get a helmet if you can or make a baseball bat for someone that doesnt have a weapon yet.</p>
